Hey! This is Yuqi.

This is a repo that is used as a dictionary for my code examples which are used in my past or previous games.
  
In each folder, there will be one or a series of c# files about one topic, which can be a designed game system, a common utility, or a tool that helps with the development. And one possible README file for some thoughts and details about this example.
    
For further information about my game works, please visit [my portfolio](http://yukiizzzx.wixsite.com/home).
